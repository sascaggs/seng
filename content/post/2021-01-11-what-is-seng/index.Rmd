Welcome to the Social Ecological Networks Group. For brevity, we use SENG (sen-jee) as a mnemonic that you'll find through the website and our social media handles. SENG is a graduate student led working group oriented that uses the network concept to think about and study social and ecological processes. You can learn more about us and our research interests by checking out the [People](https://seng.netlify.app/people/) tab.
